      <h5>4: Hori Hori Knife: </h5>
      <p>This Japanese gardening knife is a multipurpose tool that can be used for digging, weeding, planting, and cutting through tough roots and soil. Its sharp,  serrated edge makes quick work of any gardening task.</p>
      <h5>5: Garden Rake: </h5>
      <p>Use a garden  rake to level soil, remove debris, and spread mulch or compost. Choose a rake with sturdy tines and a comfortable handle for easy use.</p>
      <h5>6: Watering Can or Hose:</h5>
      <p>Proper  watering is essential for the health of your plants. Invest in a quality      watering can or hose to ensure your garden gets the moisture it needs,      whether you're watering delicate seedlings or established plants.
      </p>
      <h5>7: Wheelbarrow or Garden Cart: </h5>
      <p>Save your back from unnecessary strain by using a wheelbarrow or garden cart to transport heavy loads of soil, mulch, plants, or garden waste around your yard.</p>

      <h5>8: Garden Fork:</h5>
      <p>Break up compacted soil, aerate the ground, and turn compost with a sturdy garden fork. Look for one with sharp, durable tines that can penetrate tough soil with ease.
      </p>
      <h5>9: Pruning Saw: </h5>
      <p>For larger branches that are too thick for pruning shears, a pruning saw is      essential. Choose a saw with a sharp blade and comfortable handle for safe      and efficient cutting.
      </p>
      <h5>10: Soil Knife: </h5>
      <p>Also known as  a soil scoop or weeding knife, this handy tool is perfect for digging, planting, weeding, and dividing plants. Its serrated edge makes it easy to cut through roots and tough soil, while its pointed tip allows for      precision work in tight spaces.
